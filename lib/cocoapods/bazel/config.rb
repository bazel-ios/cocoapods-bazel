        # containing both 'debug' and 'release' dependencies.
        #
        # In other works when this flag is active cocoapods-bazel will continue to create these:
        #
        # - //Pods/cocoapods-bazel:debug
        # - //Pods/cocoapods-bazel:release
        #
        # and generate the same 'select()' statements for all attributes but 'deps'.
        #
        # Additionaly these new config_setting values will be created:
        #
        # - //Pods/cocoapods-bazel:deps_debug
        # - //Pods/cocoapods-bazel:deps_release
        # - //Pods/cocoapods-bazel:deps_debug_and_release
        #
        # and used only in the 'deps' attribute.
        #
        # This effectively decouple 'deps' from the other attributes from a configuration perspective and allow one to build
        # with different combinations of these settings. One example of a use case is generating release builds with 'debug' dependencies
        # available so debug-only features can be used to inspect/validate behaviour in a release build (some call these "dogfood" builds).
        #
        # From a conceptual perspective this will generate BUILD files with "all" states and allow one to use bazel features to 'select()' the desired ones.
        # This intentionally breaks the contract with the .podspec specification since cocoapods does not have the concept of 'select()'-ing configurations.
        #
        # Still in the context of the use case above ('dogfood' builds), without this experimental feature one would have to
        # change the configurations in the .podspec file from:
        #   `s.dependency 'Foo', configurations: %w[Debug]`
        # to:
        #   `s.dependency 'Foo', configurations: %w[Debug Release]`
        # and re-run cocoapods-bazel to generate the desired type of build and then re-run it again to go back to the previous state.
        #
        # This might be ok for some teams but it prevents others that are interested in using cocoapods-bazel to migrate to Bazel and eventually stop
        # depending on cocoapods. If the generated BUILD files don't contain "all" states and a 'pod install' is always required it's not trivial how to eventually treat the
        # BUILD files as source of truth.
